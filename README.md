### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:wave: I'm a JavaScript recruiter based in Manchester

:computer: I have been learning to code in my spare time since last year and recently started up my GitHub profile so hopefully in the next few months there will be more to see here! 

:thought_balloon: I decided to learn full stack JavaScript as working in tech recruitment always made me quite curious. It really helps me with my day job and its a great hobby to have as I've loved playing with computers since I was a kid and O'm obsessed with building & breaking things and figuring out how to automate boring tasks. 

:smiley_cat: I'm currently just under halfway through @coltsteele Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy but I supplement this by working on a side project. A way I've been using to learn JavaScript is writing my job adverts in code. 

:red_circle: I grew up in Liverpool before moving to Manchester in 2014 for University where I studied a Masters in Chemistry. And yes I'm a Red before you ask! 

:heart: I am a Mental Health and Wellbeing Ambassador 

:sparkling_heart: I volunteer with CodeYourFuture, mainly on the personal development team
